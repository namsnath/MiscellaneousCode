\section{Towers Of Hanoi}
Write a program to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem for a given N number of disks and 3 pegs.\\
The object is to move all disks from peg A to C, one at a time such that a larger disk is never over a smaller one.

Input:\\
N = 5

Output:\\
(Pegs Labelled as L - C - R)\\
Move disk 1 from L to R\\
Move disk 2 from L to C\\
Move disk 1 from R to C\\
Move disk 3 from L to R\\
Move disk 1 from C to L\\
Move disk 2 from C to R\\
Move disk 1 from L to R\\
Move disk 4 from L to C\\
Move disk 1 from R to C\\
Move disk 2 from R to L\\
Move disk 1 from C to L\\
Move disk 3 from R to C\\
Move disk 1 from L to R\\
Move disk 2 from L to C\\
Move disk 1 from R to C\\
Move disk 5 from L to R\\
Move disk 1 from C to L\\
Move disk 2 from C to R\\
Move disk 1 from L to R\\
Move disk 3 from C to L\\
Move disk 1 from R to C\\
Move disk 2 from R to L\\
Move disk 1 from C to L\\
Move disk 4 from C to R\\
Move disk 1 from L to R\\
Move disk 2 from L to C\\
Move disk 1 from R to C\\
Move disk 3 from L to R\\
Move disk 1 from C to L\\
Move disk 2 from C to R\\
Move disk 1 from L to R

\subsection{Algorithm}
\begin{easylist}
\ListProperties(Start1=1, Start2=1, Start3=1, Start4=1, Start5=1)

	& Take input for number of disks and store it in an int(N)
	& Define the pegs with characters
	& Call move(), passing N, start, intermediate and destination peg characters as parameters

\end{easylist}

\subsubsection*{void move(int N, char startPeg, char intPeg, char destPeg):}
\begin{easylist}
\ListProperties(Start1=1, Start2=1, Start3=1, Start4=1, Start5=1)

	& If N $\neq$ 0
		&& Move N - 1 disks from startPeg to intPeg (call move with parameters as N, startPeg, destPeg, intPeg)
		&& Move disk N from startPeg to destPeg
		&& Move N - 1 disks from intPeg to destPeg (call move with parameters as N, intPeg, startPeg, destPeg)
	
\end{easylist}

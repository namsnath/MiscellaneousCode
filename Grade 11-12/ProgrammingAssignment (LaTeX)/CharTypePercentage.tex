\section{Character Types and Percentage}
Write a program to find the number of each type of character in a String and calculate their respective percentages

Input:\\
Tiger Runs @ The Speed Of 100 km/hour.

Output:\\
Total Characters - 38.0\\
Uppercase Characters are 5 so, percentage = 13.157894736842104\%\\
Lowercase Characters are 20 so, percentage = 52.63157894736842\%\\
Numeric Characters are 3 so, percentage = 7.894736842105263\%\\
Other Characters are 10 so, percentage = 26.31578947368421\%

\subsection{Algorithm}
\begin{easylist}
\ListProperties(Start1=1, Start2=1, Start3=1, Start4=1, Start5=1)

	& Declare a Scanner object to take user input
	& Take user input for a String(inp)
	& Declare double variables to store number of each type of Character
	& Run a loop from i = 0 to length of input - 1, incrementing i at each iteration
		&& Extract the current character in the String and store it in a char (c)
		&& Check the type of Character and increment the respective value by 1
	& Find total of characters and print it
	& Calculate percentage of each type of character and print them out

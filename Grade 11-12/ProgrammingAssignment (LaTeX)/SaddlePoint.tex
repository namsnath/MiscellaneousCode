\section{Saddle Point}
Write a program to find the Saddle point of a matrix.\\
A saddle point is an element of the matrix such that it is the minimum element for
the row to which it belongs and the maximum element for the column to which it belongs.
Saddle point for a given matrix is always unique.


Input:\\
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
4 & 5 & 6\\
7 & 8 & 9\\
5 & 1 & 3\\
\end{tabular}

Output:\\
Saddle point = 7

\subsection{Algorithm}
\begin{easylist}
\ListProperties(Start1=1, Start2=1, Start3=1, Start4=1, Start5=1)

	& Take user input for order of matrix (n) and declare an array of size n * n
	& Run loop from i = 0 to n, incrementing by 1 at each iteration
		&& Run loop from j = 0 to n, incrementing by 1 at each iteration
			&&& Take input of element
			&&& Check for negative values
			&&& If positive, add input to array
	& Declare variables to store maximum and minimum (int) and a variable for flag and set it to 0
	& Run a loop from i = 0 to n , incrementing by 1 at each iteration
		&& Set min as A[i][0] (First element in the row), and x as 0
			&&& Run a loop from j = 0 to n, incrementing by 1 at each iteration
			&&& If A[i][j] (Current Element) is less than min, set min to current element and x to j
		&& Set max to A[0][x] (First element in column where min was found)
		&& Run a loop from i = 0 to n, incrementing by 1 at each iteration
			&&& If A[i][x] (Current element in column) is more than max, set max to current element
		&& If max is equal to min, print max value as saddle point and raise a flag
	& If flag = 0 (flag raised), Print saddle point not found

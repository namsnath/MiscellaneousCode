			<h2>About MS Dhoni:</h2>
			<p>
				Mahendra Singh Dhoni (commonly known as MS Dhoni; born July 7, 1981) is
				an Indian international cricketer who captained the Indian national team in limited-
				overs formats from 2007 to 2016 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. An attacking
				right-handed middle-order batsman and wicket-keeper, he is widely regarded as one of
				the greatest finishers in limited-overs cricket. He is also regarded as one of the best
				wicket-keepers in world cricket. <a>[5][6]</a> He made his One Day International (ODI) debut
				in December 2004 against Bangladesh, and played his first Test a year later against Sri
				Lanka.
			</p>

			<p>
				Dhoni has been the recipient of many awards, including the ICC ODI Player of the
				Year award in 2008 and 2009 (the first player to win the award twice), the Rajiv Gandhi
				Khel Ratna award in 2007, the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian honour, in
				2009 and the Padma Bhushan, India's third highest civilian honour, in 2018. He was
				named as the captain of the ICC World Test XI in 2009, 2010 and 2013. He has also
				been selected a record 8 times in ICC World ODI XI teams, 5 times as captain. The
				Indian Territorial Army conferred the honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel to Dhoni on
				1 November 2011. He is the second Indian cricketer after Kapil Dev to receive this
				honour.
			</p>

			<p>
				Dhoni also holds numerous captaincy records such as the most wins by an Indian
				captain in Tests, ODIs and T20Is, and most back-to-back wins by an Indian captain in
				ODIs. He took over the ODI captaincy from Rahul Dravid in 2007 and led the team to
				its first-ever bilateral ODI series wins in Sri Lanka and New Zealand. Under his
				captaincy, India won the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, 2007â€“08 Commonwealth Bank
				Series, the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cups, the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup and the 2013
				ICC Champions Trophy. In the final of the 2011 World Cup, Dhoni scored 91 not out
				off 79 balls handing India the victory for which he was awarded the Man of the Match.
				In June 2013, when India defeated England in the final of the Champions Trophy in
				England, Dhoni became the first captain to win all three ICC limited-overs trophies
				(World Cup, Champions Trophy and the World Twenty20). After taking up the Test
				captaincy in 2008, he led the team to series wins in New Zealand and the West Indies,
				and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in 2008, 2010 and 2013. In 2009, Dhoni also led the
				Indian team to number one position for the first time in the ICC Test rankings. In 2013,
				under his captaincy, India became the first team in more than 40 years
				to whitewash Australia in a Test series. In the Indian Premier League, he captained
				the Chennai Super Kings to victory at the 2010, 2011 and 2018 seasons, along with
				wins in the 2010 and 2014 editions of Champions League Twenty20. He announced his
				retirement from Tests on 30 December 2014.
